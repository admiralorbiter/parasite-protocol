# GDD — Parasite Protocol (Condensed)

## Player fantasy
You are a living cell running emergency protocols to defend your membrane, protect your nucleus, and prevent systemic collapse under infection.

## What makes it unique
- Builds are manufactured and delivered (logistics pressure).
- Defenses are triggered by player-built circuits (not passive turrets).
- Infection changes the map and forces triage.
- Enemies adapt to your overused strategies.

## Controls (PC)
- LMB: select/place
- RMB: cancel / context action
- Drag: pan (or WASD)
- Mouse wheel: zoom
- 1/2/3: toggle overlays (Circuit/Logistics/Infection)
- Space: pause
- Q/E: rotate placement (if needed)
- Shift: queue placement (optional)

## Player objectives
- Prevent nucleus compromise.
- Maintain membrane integrity.
- Keep ATP and stress in a survivable range.
- Contain infection below crisis thresholds.

## Lose conditions
- Nucleus HP reaches 0.
- Catastrophic collapse state (e.g., stress meltdown + ATP crash) if you implement it.
- Optional: too many breaches over time.

## Difficulty philosophy
- Early waves teach each subsystem.
- Mid waves force tradeoffs between throughput and stress.
- Late waves stress-test containment and adaptation.
- “Failure reasons” must be readable (the game should teach).

## UI views (must be togglable)
- Normal: combat readability.
- Circuit: node graph + flow.
- Logistics: shipping routes + queue status.
- Infection: spread overlay + nodes.

## Content goals (MVP)
- 3 enemy families with distinct counters.
- 4 meaningful relays that enable multiple builds.
- 2–3 “signature combos” that players discover organically.
