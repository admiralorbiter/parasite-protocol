# System — Wave Generator

## Summary
Waves are generated using a threat budget. Each enemy costs points; elites/bosses consume large shares.

## Threat budget
- Base budget scales by wave number.
- Modifiers from player success (optional): if player dominates, add small extra budget.

## Composition rules
- Each wave must include:
  - 1 primary family focus (e.g., viruses)
  - 1 secondary pressure (e.g., infection spreaders)
- Avoid too many mechanics at once early.

## Example scaling (MVP suggestion)
Wave 1–2: teach breaches + basic enemies
Wave 3–4: introduce infection nodes + shipping stall pressure
Wave 5–6: introduce disruptor/corruptor
Wave 7–8: mixed compositions + adaptation in full effect
Wave 9: boss

## Recovery phase
- Offer 3 gene cards
- Offer 1 repair option (cleanse zone / repair membrane / boost ATP)
- Allow limited reroute/build time (timer or until ready)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Waves feel distinct and escalate meaningfully.
- [ ] Budget is deterministic for a given seed (optional).
- [ ] Recovery is fast and readable.
