# Parasite Protocol — Documentation Pack

Generated: 2026-01-05

This folder contains a starter documentation set for developing **Parasite Protocol** (2D).

## Recommended repo layout
```
/docs/  (this folder)
/src/
/assets/
/tools/
```

## Suggested next steps
1. Read **PRD.md** then **GDD.md**.
2. Implement MVP systems in the order found in **Roadmap_Backlog.md**.
3. Use **Data_Schemas.md** to define your in-engine data objects.
4. Start authoring content using **Content_Authoring_Guide.md**.

## Definitions of Done
Each system doc includes a *Definition of Done* checklist to keep implementation crisp.

Good luck — and have fun making cells suffer.
